# Pull Bankings of Associated Revocable Trust

## System Rule
- When the switch for Revocable trust is ON in the [Associated Entities](../legal-entities/associated-entities.md) tab for Individual and Joint, the system will auto pull the banking accounts of that Revocable Trust into its Trustor.
- Both `Active` and `Disposed` banking records can be pulled.
- Can be pulled only if the Trustor is added in the current trust.
- When an Individual of the Joint is added as a Trustor in any Revocable trust and the trust has banking accounts, the system will auto pull the banking accounts of the trust into the Individual and its Joint.
