# My Task - Open tab

Every Athena user has a personal Task Queue that’s maintained by the system, includes all tasks for which the user is listed as Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed.

Each Tasks in this page is organized into the following buckets:
**Overdue**: Due Date has passed, task is not marked as Succeeded; user is Responsible or Accountable.

**This Week**: Due Date is this week, ending on upcoming Saturday midnight Pacific time. User is Responsible or Consulted.

**Next Week**: Due Date is not before the end of this week, but is before the end of next Saturday midnight Pacific time. User is Responsible or Consulted. 

**Future**: Notification Date is more than 2 weeks away; user is Responsible.

**Done**: all tasks marked as Succeeded in the last N weeks. User is Responsible or Accountable.



## View as other user

A “View as” function will allow one user to view another’s Personal Queue. There will be no restrictions on which user can view which other user’s queues.

## New & Reopened tag

When a task appears in a bucket for the first time, and the user has not yet clicked upon it, show it highlighted, e.g. with a NEW flag like in Kerika.
