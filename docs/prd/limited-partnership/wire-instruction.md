# Wire Instruction

When Clarius clients invest in Private Capital Funds (we identify those as Limited Partnerships) those investment funds call capital periodically.  Clarius teams process a lot of these calls each year (currently about 600 private capital investments).  Our goal with this new feature is to streamline this process for the teams.

When a fund raise capital call instruction, Clarius team can enter wire instructions under and add its [investors](./investor.md)
