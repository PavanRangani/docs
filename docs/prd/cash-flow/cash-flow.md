### Add/Edit Pro Forma/actual data of a Year
#### System Rule
- User can't change/enter the `Pro Forma` for a completed year.
- User can't change/enter the Actual amount for the current year. 

#### UX Rule
- Logic of the `Differences` column, if any past year has a value of `Pro Forma`, the system shows the `Difference` column. (This difference amount is not shown on the view page)
    - It is a calculated field. `Differences` = `Actual` - `Pro Forma`
        - Negative amount is shown in the `()`.
        - For `Cash Uses` of both sections, 
            - System will caluclate the `Differences` amount based on a maths formula.
            - For e.g. 
                - If the `Actual` amount is `-2000` and `Pro Forma` is `-2000`. So the Differences is `-1000 - (-2000) = -1000 + 2000 = 1000`.
                - If the `Actual` amount is `-5000` and `Pro Forma` is `-2000`. So the Differences is `-5000 - (-2000) = -5000 + 2000 = -3000`.
- Shows `Pro Forma` column disabled for a completed year. When it's disabled, system shows a proper message.
- Shows `Actual` column disabled for the current year. When it's disabled, system shows a proper message.

#### UI Rule
- [Mockup with difference column](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrvvEgsBIU4dTIxo6b1m9at6W1P477y7/view?usp=sharing)
- Message for `Pro Forma` column: `You can't enter a Pro Forma for the completed year.` [See this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HlearnPRWl35iQqyzGXHzp-UI2_8uB6y/view?usp=sharing)
- Message for `Pro Forma` column: `You can enter Actual amount after Jan 1, {Next Year}` [See this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zs4bB8k5WMVIOPWzXc4cCIuoKNtJJ39B/view?usp=sharing)

### Export Annual Cash Flows

#### System Rule
- System allows the export of `Annual Cash Flows` data in the form of Excel and PDF.
- Export functionality isn't available, when the list page doesnâ€™t have any records in any column.

#### UX Rule
- Both icons are disabled when the table doesn't have any records.
    - Case: Suppose the current year is `2023`. Default table shows last 5 years column. But even if I have record in last 6th year, icon also appears.
- On click of Excel icon, excel file will be downloaded in same page.
- On click of PDF icon, PDF file will be downloaded in same page. 
- On hover of Excel and PDF icon, show tooltip message.
- Negative amount is shown in red color and Positive amount is shown in normal black color.
- Excel file name: `annual-cash-flow-of-{entity name}.pdf`
- PDF file name: `annual-cash-flow-of-{entity name}.xlsx`
- For `PDF`
    - If a user exports a pdf with `Last 5 Year`, the PDF file will be downloaded with a Portrait layout.
    - If the user exports a pdf with `Last 10 Year`, the PDF file will be downloaded with `Lat 7 year` a landscape layout.
        - Note: Due to width problem in PDF, We have not shown last 10 years record. So system shows last 7 years records.
- For `Excel`,
    - Use excel formatting to represent negative numbers in bracket
    - Use formula to show the sum where total is shown
    - Show `Pro Forma` column with background color.
    - Total Uses and sources are shown in bold
    - Net row is shown with background color
    - Shows metadata at top for Excel file
        - Generated On
            - System shows on UTC time when file is downloaded.
        - Entity 
        - Duration: It is either `Last 5 Years` or `Last 10 Years`.

#### UI Rule
- See [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVi31srhMFzY39-rmQQgBCr45l8xLGuxiwNcZkfXUYY/edit?usp=drivesdk)

### Cash Flow tab - Enable/Disable tab logic
- Cash Flow tab always appears enabled. Because the system has to handle many cases to enable/disable the tab. So instead of implementing complex logic in the system, we will always show the Cash Flow tab as enabled. See the following complex cases:
    - Top table has data but bottom section doesn't have data.
    - Default system shows last 5 years. If the user has data for the last 8th year, its not visible in viewport but tab is shown enabled
    - User can only see the last 10 years' record. If the entity has records for last 11th year, then its not visible in view port but tab is shown enabled
