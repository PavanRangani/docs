- Allows to add meeting/notes from this tab. 
- Also shows the `Related meetings` where this legal entity is selected as `Related entity` and `Investment` tag is applied. [See more details](../communication/meeting-notes.md#meeting-notes)
- Meeting/Notes can be added as Individual level and also at Joint level. So for Joint, it shows meeting/notes of individuals and Joint both
- For Joint, show one column `Entity Name`
  - If records are pulled from individuals then shows that individuals legal entity name otherwise shows `Joint` name.
- Shows `+` button on the top right side of the page. On hover of + button, shows tooltip message with proper message.
- On click of + button, opens a dropdown of `Add Meeting` & `Add Note`.
