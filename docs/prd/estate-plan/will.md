### Logic of Testamentary trust section

- When user add a new will, show only active (Current Will) testamantoty trust and opens any history will, show both active or inactive (Current & Will History) Testamentary trust in the Trust name dropdown.

- When Testamentary trust is not linked with any of the Will, that testamentary trust is auto delete.

- When the user selects any existing testamantary trust and makes any changes to it. So the existing records of that testamantary trust will also be updated.

- Do not allowed to enter same name while that trust is available in Will history. in this case system show error.

- One testamentary trust is available in current Will and same trust is also available in Will history, that means this trust is active `Testamentary trust`.

- Individuals delete is not possible while that individual is added as a first, second and beneficiaries in the Testamantory trust.
