## Stores unsaved changes of Chat in Local storage
- Chat can be added from three places in the application: Chat tab of task view dialog, Reply from Chat Notifications dialog and My Chat page
- To avoid accidental removal of Chat messages, UI app stores unsaved changes in local storage
- UI app stores this unsaved changes on per task basis. This storage is common for all three pages. It means if user has some unsaved changes for any task in My chat tab, that will be also visible in Reply box from Chat notification dialog or My Chat page. 
- Unsaved changes in local storage is saved or updated when user leaves the Chat box (its not updated in live when user is typing the content). For e.g. If user has typed something in Chat tab and user is still in Chat tab, content are not saved in local storage. But if user switches to the `Note` tab or user close the dialog, Unsaved changes in Chat tab will be stored in local storage.
