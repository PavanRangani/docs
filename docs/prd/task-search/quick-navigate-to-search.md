# Quick navigation to search using Keyboard shortcut

## UX Rule
- When a user is on my task or Group task or My Chat page and presses the `ctrl + /` or `cmd + /`, Search box will open and focus will be set to the Search.
- If user has already opened search dialog and press the `ctrl + /` or `cmd + /`, it will have no effect
