# Sorting order of each search results


## System Rule
- Each Search result item has some score which is generated by Elastic search. Elastic search provides score based on how many times the term is matched and where it is matched. 
- We have configured this priority for scoring in ES : `Task Title > Sub-task name > Notes > Chats`
- When score of two or more tasks is the same, then the sorting is done based upon `last updated` status. The most recent updated tasks get the top position.
