# GST Summary

In addition to Lifetime Exemption, Individual can also have GST tax exemption. GST stands for Generation Skipping Transfer tax. Each individual has a certain amount of "GST" gifts they can make during their life, or at death. It is a second table similar to Lifetime exemption but it has different limits.

Here, The child's generation is skipped to avoid an inheritance being subject to estate taxes twiceâ€”once when it moves from the grandparents to their children, and then from those children to their children. 

While all regular gifts reduce the "Lifetime exemption", only gifts marked as "GST" will be allocated against the balance of this GST Exemption.



## How it works

Athena maintains GST exemption ledger for each Individual separately. To maintain this ledger, it uses 709 (Gift tax return) data. 709 return (Gift Tax Return) has data about GST Gift made for a particular year, Annual exclusion & Tax paid information.

Using this tax return data Athena maintains GST exemption ledger for each Individual as shown in below table // TODO
