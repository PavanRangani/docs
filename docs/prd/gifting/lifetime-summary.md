# Lifetime Summary

## Overview

This page shows the remaining Lifetime exemption limit for any particular Individual. Using this page Clarius team can know how much limit is available for any Individual

#### What is Annual Exclusion

For the tax years 2020 and 2021, the annual exclusion is $15,000. Individuals won’t have to file a gift tax return until they gift at least that much to another individual in one tax year. For example, if any Individual gift someone $20,000, that Individual will have to file a gift tax return for $5,000, which is the amount over the annual exclusion. Filing a gift tax return doesn’t mean Individual have to pay gift taxes. 

The concept of "Annual exclusion" is much more complicated with the GST gifts, so we will not have Athena calculate this.  System has only a data field at 709 tax return that Clarius team enters after the accountants file the gift tax return.

#### What is Lifetime Exemption

Starting in 2020, the lifetime gift tax exemption is $11.58 million. This means that Individual can give up to $11.58 million in gifts over the course of your lifetime without ever having to pay gift tax on it. Government can increase this amount in upcoming years. So this figure can be increased over time.

For Joints, both Individual get the $11.58 million exemption. It means that both Individual can give away a total of $23.16 million before paying the gift tax.

For example, if Individual gifted someone $20,000, He has to file a gift tax return for $5,000, the amount over the annual exclusion, but that $5,000 will be deducted from lifetime exclusion amount.  So if he has not used that limit yet, he may not have to pay taxes on that money yet.

## How Summary tab works

Athena maintains Lifetime exemption ledger for each Individual separately. To maintain this, it uses data of Gifts Given, Manualy added Prior year record & 709 tax return. 

System auto calculates Annual Exclusion value. See below How Annual exclusion is set.

System recalculates this summary ledger whenever any Gift is added/edited/deleted, any prior year record is added/edited/deleted and Annual exclusion value of Tax return is changed.

Each year record of this ledger is bifurcated in to three types: Manual, Auto & Pulled.

Manually added records are called Manual. 

Records which are pulled from Gifts Given and Tax return are called Pulled.

Records auto generated by system to maintain continuous ledger from lowest year to current year are called Auto.



### How Annual Exclusion is set

#### Exception



### Why we allow to enter prior year data manually?

To show the correct Remaining Lifetime Exemption amount on this page for any particular Individual, Athena should have all lifetime 709 tax return data available in Athena. 709 return pulls total gift amount data from Gifting page. So indirectly it means that system should have all of the gifts given by Individual during his lifetime entered in to Gifting module to reflect correct figure on this page. This can become very painful work. Athena had Gifts data available for many individual, but its not like that those data are for the whole lifetime.

So we have given one feature to create manual entry (Without creating any Gift) for any particular year in Lifetime exemption ledger.

This feature can also be used for data entry of any new client of Clarius group. Clarius team don't have to create gifts of old years. They can directly enter data manually from this page using old tax returns (from accountant) to reflect correct figures on this page.

Note: We have added this feature in Athena in June 2021

## Browse lifetime Summary 

### UX Rule

- Shows lifetime Exemption summary of particular Individual on year over year basis using 709 Tax return data or Manually entered data.
- For Joint legal entity, this page shows data for both individuals.
- It shows the records from smallest year to current year in ascending order
  - For e.g If current year is 2021 and smallest year in which Gift available is 2015, then this page will show records from 2015 to 2021
- When there isn't any gifts available for any year, shows only one record for current year showing Remaining Lifetime exemption (This is just to show the Remaining Exemption figure. Otherwise for such Individual there isn't any way to see Remaining Exemption)
  - For e.g If current year is 2021 and this Individual don't have any gifts available in any year, then this page will show only one record for 2021
- For each year, this page shows following columns
  - Year
  - Annual Increase
    - Annual increase by government for this year. 
  - Statutory Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption
    - Total available exemption by this year
  - Beginning Lifetime Exemption
  - Annual Gift Amount
  - Annual Exclusion
    - Pulled from Tax Return for the same year.
  - Lifetime Exemption Used
  - Remaining Lifetime Exemption
  - Tax Paid
    - Pulled “Tax Due” value for the same year.
- From above columns, first 3 columns `Year, Annual Increase & Statutory Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption`  shows figures from Master ledger. All other column values are shown from either Tax return or Manual entry.
- Show `-` if data is not available in a particular column.
- When no gifts are available for any year, then show this “No Gift tax returns have been filed for {Year} year" message in the Annual Gift Amount column
  - for e.g.  Current year is 2021 and smallest year in which Gift available is 2015. User has gifts availble in 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2020.  This page will show records from 2015 to 2021. On this page for the years 2018, 2019 & 2021, it will show message like `No Gift tax returns have been filed for 2018 year`

#### UI Rule

- No Gifts available for Individual
- Page with some records available



## Add summary record for prior year

- System allows to enter prior year record for both - Lifetime and GST
- Does not allow to enter record before 1980
- Does not allow to enter GST details before 1985
- Does not allow to enter future year record
- System does not allow to enter record for the year which is already exists in ledger
- System always ensures that GST gift amount is less than Annual Gift amount (Because GST is subset of Lifetime)

### UX Rule

- `Lifetime Summary`tab has ADD button. On click opens Add dialog of Prior year.

- Year Input
  - Its year input and mandatory field.
  - Its value always greater than or equal to 1980.
  - Future year is not allowed to enter.
  - Same year isn't allowed.
  
- Lifetime summary details

  - Beginning Lifetime Exemption

    - When a user enters a year in the `Year Input` field then update this header name to `Beginning Lifetime Exemption ({Year})`.
    - Based on the selected Year, data are pulled from the Individual's ledger.
    - Decimal input is allowed.

    - Annual Gift Amount
      - Its amount input field. Decimal is allowed.
      - It's a mandatory field.
    - Annual Exemption

      - Its value should be always lower than `Annual Gift Amount`.
    - Lifetime Exemption Used
      - Its calculated field. Decimal is allowed.
      - `Lifetime Exemption Used` = `Annual Gift Amount` - `Annual Exclusion]`
    - Remaining Lifetime Exemption
      - When a user enters a year in the Year Input field then update this header name to `Beginning Lifetime Exemption ({Year})`.
      - It's a calculated field.
      - `Remaining Lifetime Exemption(1998)` = `Beginning Lifetime Exemption` - `Lifetime Exemption Used`
      - If the value of `Remaining Lifetime Exemption` is less than 0, show only 0 in this field. (Do not show value with `-` sign)
    - Tax Paid
      - Its amount input field. Decimal is allowed.

- GST summary details

  - When user enters same year in `Year Input` field then system shows an error message.

- Errro cases

  - When `Annual Exemption` is grater than `Annual Gift Amount` then system shows an error message.
  - When user enters a year is lower than 1980 then system shows an error message. 
  - When user enters a future year in the `Year Input` field then system shows an error message.

### UI Rule

Mockup //TODO

- Error message for same year: `Lifetime Summary with same name already exits`.

- Error message for `Annual Exemption` : `Should be <= Annual Gift Amount`.
- Error message when Year in lower than 1980 : `Should be >=1980`
- Error message when future year is added: `Should be <= {Current Year} (Current Year)`.



## Edit Summary record

### System Rule

- Applicable only for `Manual` and `Auto` type records.
- Can be editable anytime.
- If the user edits the `Auto` type of records and adds a summary to it, the type will change from `Auto` to `Manual`.
- If the user adds a gift for the year of  `Auto` type, its type will be changed to `Pull`.

### UX Rule

- Year can't be changed.

### UI Rule

Mockup //TODO

### Case 1

- For Ex. If a new user `Ajay Dhameliya` is connected to the Athena Family Office from 2021. Now the user has given a gift from 2015 to 2019. So we will add manual records for 2015. The system will now auto-add records from 2015 to 2021. The type of record for 2015 will be `Manual` and record for 2016 to 2021 will be `Auto`. User can not able to add records for 2016 year because it is already added to the summary tab.
- If the user wants to add a summary for 2016, he can add a summary by editing the 2016 records. Now if the user manually adds a summary for 2016, it will change the type of records from `Auto` to `Manual`.



## Delete Summary record of prior year

### System Rule

- Applicable only for first records of Manual type.

### UX Rule

- On click, open delete confirmation dialog.

### UI Rule

Mockup of Delete confirmation dialog //TODO



## Auto Delete Summary records

There are 2 cases for auto delete summary records. I have explained each with an example below.

#### Case 1: When the user manually deletes the first manual records of the Summary tab, the system will auto-delete all subsequent `Auto` type records.

- Ex. I have added a manual record for the 2002 year. So the system will auto-create records from 2003 to 2021 (Current year) in the summary tab. The type of records created by the system will be `Auto` and the type of records created by the user will be `Manual`.
- Now if the user deletes the first `Manual` records of 2002, the system will auto delete all the `Auto` type records up to 2020 (Current year -1).
- In the above example, suppose I have a record for 2015 that is pulled from the gift and now if the user deletes the 2002 records, the system will auto-delete all the `Auto` type records up to 2014. 2015 records have been pulled so the system will not be able to delete records from 2015 to 2020.
- Similarly, even if I have manually added records for 2015, the system will not be able to auto-delete records from 2015 to 2020.



#### Case 2: If I change the type of gift from `Lifetime Gift` to `GST Gift`, the system will auto-delete all records in the `Lifetime Summary` tab and vice versa.

- Ex. I have added one lifetime gift in the given tab for 2004. So the system will auto-create records from 2004 to 2021 (Current Year) in the Lifetime Summary tab. Now I change the type of gift for the 2004 year from `Lifetime` to `GST`. So the records from 2004 to 2021 will be added in the `GST Summary` tab and the system will auto-delete all the records from 2004 to 2021 from the `Lifetime Summary` tab.
- In the example above, suppose I have a tax return for 2012. So the system will auto-delete only the records from 2004 to 2011 from the `Lifetime Summary` tab.
