# Lifetime Summary

## Overview

This page shows the remaining Lifetime exemption limit for any particular Individual. Using this page Clarius team can know how much limit is available for any Individual

#### What is Annual Exclusion

For the tax years 2020 and 2021, the annual exclusion is $15,000. Individuals won’t have to file a gift tax return until they gift at least that much to another individual in one tax year. For example, if any Individual gift someone $20,000, that Individual will have to file a gift tax return for $5,000, which is the amount over the annual exclusion. Filing a gift tax return doesn’t mean Individual have to pay gift taxes. 

The concept of "Annual exclusion" is much more complicated with the GST gifts, so we will not have Athena calculate this.  System has only a data field at 709 tax return that Clarius team enters after the accountants file the gift tax return.

#### What is Lifetime Exemption

Starting in 2020, the lifetime gift tax exemption is $11.58 million. This means that Individual can give up to $11.58 million in gifts over the course of your lifetime without ever having to pay gift tax on it. Government can increase this amount in upcoming years. So this figure can be increased over time.

For Joints, both Individual get the $11.58 million exemption. It means that both Individual can give away a total of $23.16 million before paying the gift tax.

For example, if Individual gifted someone $20,000, He has to file a gift tax return for $5,000, the amount over the annual exclusion, but that $5,000 will be deducted from lifetime exclusion amount.  So if he has not used that limit yet, he may not have to pay taxes on that money yet.

## How Summary tab works?

Athena maintains Lifetime exemption ledger for each Individual separately. To maintain this, it uses data of Gifts Given, Manually added Prior year record & 709 tax return. 

System auto calculates Annual Exclusion value. See below How Annual exclusion is set.

System recalculates this summary ledger whenever any Gift is added/edited/deleted, any prior year record is added/edited/deleted and Annual exclusion value of Tax return is changed.

Each year record of this ledger is bifurcated in to three types: Manual, Auto & Pulled.

Manually added records are called Manual. 

Records which are pulled from Gifts Given and Tax return are called `Pulled`.

Records auto generated by system to maintain continuous ledger from lowest year to current year are called Auto.

If user adds any gift for the year whose type is  `Auto` , its type will be changed to `Pulled`. 

If  user edits the `Auto` type of records and add some details to it, the type will change from `Auto` to `Manual`.



### How Annual Exclusion is set Auto?

##### When user gives a gift greater than 15,000 to an individual in a single year, the value of `Annual Exclusion` will be set at 15,000. This is true for Gifts from 2018. Gifts before 2018, Annual Exclusion value is 14000 in this case.

###### Scenario 1 

Giftor has given a gift of `16,000` to one individual. Here `Gift Amount` is greater than `15,000` so `Annual Exclusion` is set to `15,000`.  The summary tab for this Giftor will appear as below

###### Scenario 2 

Giftor has given a gift of `10,000` and `16,000` to two different individuals. So here  `Annual Exclusion` is set to `25,000 (15,000 + 10,000)` and `Annual Gift Amount` is set to `26,000`. The summary tab for this Giftor will appear as below

###### Scenario 3

Giftor has given a gift of `16,000` and `16,000` to two different individuals. So here `Annual Gift Amount` is `32,000`. The summary tab for this Giftor will appear as below where `Annual Gift Amount` is `32,000` and the value of `Annual Exclusion` is set to `30,000 (15,000 + 15,000)`.

###### Scenario 4

//TODO : for gifts of 2016

##### If a user gives a gift less than 15,000 to an individual in a single year, the value of `Gift Amount` will be set to `Annual Exclusion`. 

###### Scenario 1 

Giftor has given a gift of `12,000` to one individual. Here `Gift Amount` is less than`15,000`. Summary tab for this Giftor will appear as below where `Annual Gift Amount` is `12,000` and the value of `Annual Exclusion` is set to `12,000`.

Image //TODO

###### Scenario 2

Giftor has given gifts of 10000 to 5 different individuals. Here the `Annual Gift Amount` is `50,000`. The summary tab for tis Giftor will appear as below where `Annual Exclusion` is set to `50,000`.

#### Exception

Annual exclusion is not always set by system . There is one case where system won't set Annual Exclusion auto. 

When any user has set the exclusion manually from the tax return page, then system will never override it.

### UX Rule

- Shows lifetime Exemption summary of particular Individual on year over year basis.
- For Joint legal entity, this page shows data for both individuals.
- It shows the records from smallest year to current year in ascending order
  - For e.g If current year is 2021 and smallest year in which Gift available is 2015, then this page will show records from 2015 to 2021
- For each year, this page shows following columns
  - Year
  - Annual Increase
    - Annual increase by government for this year. 
  - Statutory Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption
    - Total available exemption by this year

- From above columns, first 3 columns `Year, Annual Increase & Statutory Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption`  shows figures from Master ledger. All other column values are shown from either Gifts given, Tax return or Manual entry.
- Show `-` if data is not available in a particular column.
- When there isn't any gifts available for any year, shows only one record for current year showing Remaining Lifetime exemption (This is just to show the Remaining Exemption figure. Otherwise for such Individual there isn't any way to see Remaining Exemption)
  - For e.g If current year is 2021 and this Individual don't have any gifts available in any year, then this page will show only one record for 2021
- When no gifts are available for any particular year, then shows  “No Gift tax returns have been filed for {Year} year" message in the Annual Gift Amount column
  - for e.g.  Current year is 2021 and smallest year in which Gift available is 2015. User has gifts availble in 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2020.  This page will show records from 2015 to 2021. On this page for the years 2018, 2019 & 2021, it will show message like `No Gift tax returns have been filed for 2018 year`
- For Auto and Manual records, shows Edit action
- For First record shows Delete action. Delete is only available if first record is of type Auto and Manual

#### UI Rule

- Mocup: No Gifts available for Individual
- Mockup: Page with some records available
- Mockups: for Joint





## Auto Delete Summary records

There are 2 cases for auto delete summary records. I have explained each with an example below.

#### Case 1: When the user manually deletes the first manual records of the Summary tab, the system will auto-delete all subsequent `Auto` type records.

- Ex. I have added a manual record for the 2002 year. So the system will auto-create records from 2003 to 2021 (Current year) in the summary tab. The type of records created by the system will be `Auto` and the type of records created by the user will be `Manual`.
- Now if the user deletes the first `Manual` records of 2002, the system will auto delete all the `Auto` type records up to 2020 (Current year -1).
- In the above example, suppose I have a record for 2015 that is pulled from the gift and now if the user deletes the 2002 records, the system will auto-delete all the `Auto` type records up to 2014. 2015 records have been pulled so the system will not be able to delete records from 2015 to 2020.
- Similarly, even if I have manually added records for 2015, the system will not be able to auto-delete records from 2015 to 2020.



#### Case 2: If I change the type of gift from `Lifetime Gift` to `GST Gift`, the system will auto-delete all records in the `Lifetime Summary` tab and vice versa.

- Ex. I have added one lifetime gift in the given tab for 2004. So the system will auto-create records from 2004 to 2021 (Current Year) in the Lifetime Summary tab. Now I change the type of gift for the 2004 year from `Lifetime` to `GST`. So the records from 2004 to 2021 will be added in the `GST Summary` tab and the system will auto-delete all the records from 2004 to 2021 from the `Lifetime Summary` tab.
- In the example above, suppose I have a tax return for 2012. So the system will auto-delete only the records from 2004 to 2011 from the `Lifetime Summary` tab.
