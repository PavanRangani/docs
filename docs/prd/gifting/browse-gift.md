- For Individual and Joint, shows 2 tabs - Given & Received
- For Partnership and Trust, Only shows one tab - Received
- In Given tab, records are shown in Group by of Recipient
- In Received tab, records are shown in Group by of Giftor

- Shows `Inirect` tag for the Gifts in list page for the `Indirect` Gift.
  - `Indirect` gift means Gift which are not given directly.  For e.g. If gift is given to Partnership, then for the owner of that partnership, its `Indirect` Gift because its not given to owner directly but its given via Partnership
- For Foundation and Estate gifting is not applicable, so in main tab, `Gifting` won't be available
