# Show entity tasks

All tasks in Athena can also be viewed and updated in the context of the entity: when viewing any Individual, Joint, Trust, Partnership, Foundation, or Estate a new tab `Tasks` tab under `Contact` tab provides a summary of all tasks associated with that particular entity.

By default, it also shows the tasks of the associated entities. 

These tasks are grouped in the same buckets/tabs as the My tasks page (Personal Queue of the user)
