## System Rule

- System allows the export of tasks to the users in the form of Excel and PDF.
- Export functionality isn't available, when the list page doesnâ€™t have any tasks.
- System allows users to export tasks with filtered or without filtered.



## UX Rule

- Both icons are disabled when the list page doesn't have any task.

- On click of Excel icon, excel file will be downloaded in same page.

- On click of PDF icon, PDF file will be downloaded in same page.

- Excel/PDF file name for **My task page**
  - Open tab
    - My task page: `open-tasks.xlsx` or `open-tasks.pdf`
    - Entity task: `{entity name}-open-tasks.xlsx` or `{entity name}-open-tasks.pdf`
  - Upcoming Tab
    - My task page:  `upcoming-tasks.xlsx` or `upcoming-tasks.pdf`
    - Entity task: `{entity name}-upcoming-tasks.xlsx` or `{entity name}-upcoming-tasks.pdf`
  - Completed Tab
    - My Task : `completed-tasks.xlsx` or `completed-tasks.pdf`
    - Entity task: `{entity name}-completed-tasks.xlsx` or `{entity name}-completed-tasks.pdf`
  - Recurring Tab
    - My task page: `recurring-tasks.xlsx` or  `recurring-tasks.pdf`
    - Entity task: `{entity name}-recurring-tasks.xlsx` or `{entity name}-recurring-tasks.pdf`
  
  
  
- **Sorting order**: Sorting order will be same as the UI. [See this](./browse-my-tasks/#browse-open-tasks)
