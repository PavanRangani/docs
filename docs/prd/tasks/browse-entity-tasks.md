# Browse Entity tasks

All tasks in Athena can also be viewed and updated in the context of the entity: when viewing any Individual, Joint, Trust, Partnership, Foundation, or Estate a new tab `Tasks` tab under `Contact` tab provides a summary of all tasks associated with that particular entity.

By default, Entity tasks page shows the tasks of all [Associated entities](../legal-entities/associated-entities.md)

These tasks are shown in the same tabs as the [My tasks page](./browse-my-tasks.md) (Personal Queue of the user): Open, Upcoming, Completed, Recurring

There are some differences in this page compared to My tasks page as following
- View as Other user function is not available
- Family filter is not available
