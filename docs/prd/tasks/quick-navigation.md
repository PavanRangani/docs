# Quick Navigation between My Task and Group Task

## Overview

We have provided a way to quick navigate between My Task and Group Task page so that the user can switch to other page.

## UX Rule
- `My Task` page shows button `GO TO GROUP TASK` and `Group Task` page shows button `GO TO MY TASK`. 
    - This button is not applicable for the `Recurring` and `Multi-step templates` tab of the `My Task` page.
- On click of a button, redirects the user to the other page in same browser tab. It will also preserve the tab
    - E.g. If user is on Open tab for the My Task page and click on the button `GO TO GROUP TASK`, it will open the Open tab of Group task page
