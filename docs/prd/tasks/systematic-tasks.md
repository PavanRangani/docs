## Enable/Disable at Family level

When we are onboarding a new family, we don’t want the system to be generating all kinds of ticklers that do more harm than good. My proposal is that at the Family level, we introduce an “Onboarding” checkbox. During the onboarding time (which is typically 45-120 days), the ticklers are not imposed against the family data. However, once the onboarding is deemed complete, we will uncheck this box and the ticklers will begin to populate. 

This is also going to be very important as we roll out this feature for the first time across all families. We will start with all families in the “onboarding” state and we will release each family as the team has had a chance to validate that we are ready for the ticklers. If we don’t have some type of control here, the teams will be blasted with too many ticklers and it will not be good.
