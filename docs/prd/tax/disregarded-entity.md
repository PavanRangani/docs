# Disregarded Entity tax return

## Overview
- Sometimes Partnerships and Trusts don't have their own tax return. But its tax return is filed under Grantor or Individual or Owner tax return. So we have given one new option `Disregarded Entity` option from the tax return where the user can enter this tax return.

## Disregarded tax return in Partnership and Trust

### System Rule
- Disregarded Entity tax return is applicable only for the Trust and partnership.
- If `Trust is Grantor trust` & `Partnership is Individual SSN` & `Partnership is LLC-EIN-Single owner`, allows entering disregarded entity tax return.
  - For LLC - EIN - Single owner means the Single individual, Two individuals of the same Joint.
- Disregarded entity tax returns have only the Components section. It doesn't have other information like Preparation, Federal return (Payment, Return Summary) and State return. 
  - So when the user changes the Form from Disregarded Entity to Other form or vice-versa, the system adds/delete some of the data of the return.
- If the `Grantor to` or `Individual SSN` or `Owner` tax return is filed, system will not allow to filing of a disaregaded entity tax return for that year. 
- Tax Component will be pulled to the `Grantor to` or `Individual SSN` or `Owner` tax return.
- When any Trust or Partnership tax return is created, the system shows information due to the existing return won't be changed.
  - For Trust, it is Grantor or Not.
  - For Partnership, `Partnership Type` or `Individual SSN or EIN` or `Single owner or not`. 
- If the user changes the Individual SSN, the system won't update the existing SSN value from the existing return.
