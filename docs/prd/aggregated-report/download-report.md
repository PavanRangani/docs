# Download aggregated report



## Overview

Aggregated PDF report, which we are building this time is not same as our regular report PDF. This PDF is bigger in size and system needs to gather data from various modules to generate PDF. Our assumption is, It is going to take around 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on the reports it will contain. Also it is going to consume more resources of server compared to normal reports especially memory. So system wonâ€™t be able to handle more than two or three such request in parallel.

If we keep this process synchronous user needs to wait 1 to 2 minutes and user can not perform any other action. So instead of making download process synchronous, we have made it asynchronous. 

## System rules

- System maintains queue for aggregated report download requests. System processes each request one by one
- System will process n request concurrently (Currently we will keep this value of n = 1 or 2, so system will handle two requests concurrently). We can increase this number by observing memory usage and increase memory. Currently our server has 1 GB memory. We can increase it, if we want to handle more requests concurrently. (It will increase cost)
- Once user submit Download request, request will be in either WAITING or IN_PROGRESS state
- If queue is empty, status will be IN_PROGRESS. If Download request is in queue, status will be WAITING
- When Download request is failed due to any reason, status will be FAILED
- Once process is completed, status will be set to COMPLETED



### UX

- Shows all download requests in single dialog at bottom right corner of the screen
- This dialog is visible in any screen of the application.
- For IN_PROGRESS request, shows loader
- For WAITING request, shows waiting icon
- For FAILED requests, shows error icon and provides a way to remove that requests
- For COMPLETED requests, UI downloads the PDF file and removes that requests from dialog
- All requests in dialog are shown in the descending order of its submission. Means first submitted request is shown at top.
