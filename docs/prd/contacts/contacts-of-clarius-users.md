# Contacts of App Users

## Overview

- Contacts are also created for the users of the application (Clarius users). Such contacts are used in application whenever required for for that user for e.g. as meeting attendees for meeting with clients.  
- In PDF summary of such meeting, actual clients should be listed ahead of such contacts. But application doesn't have any way to distinguish between contact of clients and contacts of the Clarius users.  To solve this problem, we have introduced the concept of  `Contacts of App Users`
- For each user of the application system will create one correspondent contact. System will mark such contacts as `Contacts of App users`

## System requirements

### Create

- Can't be created manually. When any new user is added to the application, system will auto create related contact.
- At the time of creating a contact from the user, system will use the name and email address of user to create related contact.

### Edit

- Email address can't be changed. 
- Name or any other information can be changed

### Delete

- Not possible

### Archive

- Can be activated/archived independent of the User status (active or block)

### View

- Shows some sign to show Contacts of app users
