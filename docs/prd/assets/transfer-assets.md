# Transfer Assets

## Overview

- Real life use case
  - Sunny transferred his home into a Trust.
  - Bob and Deb George will be transferring their homes into a Trust. 
- To handle above cases asset need to removed from one entity and needs to be added to another manually
- To solve that problem we have introduced feature to transfer asset from one legal entity to another legal entity

- Assets can be only transferred to another legal entity of the same family.

## Transfer

- At the time of transfer, it asks for `Transferred On` date and `Transferred To` legal entity.
  - If the current asset has a `Purchased On` date, the `Transferred On` date should always be equal to or greater than the `Purchased On` date.  If the asset does not have a `Purchased On` date then the user can add any date to the `Transferred On  ` date.
  - Only show the Active legal entity of the same family in the `Transferred To` field. And Source Legal entity does not come in `Transferred To` field dropdown.
- Assets can be linked with many types of Banking. In Banking, the asset field allows to select only assets of the same legal entity. 
  - If an asset is linked in active Banking, it doesnâ€™t allow to transfer. If it's linked with Disposed Banking, transfer is allowed.
- Assets can also be linked to Insurance. Asset field in insurance allows to select assets of any legal entity of the same family.
  - Suppose an asset is linked in Insurance. When that asset is transferred to any other legal entity, it will remain linked with existing insurance as it is after the transfer. 	
  - One Edge case : Transferred asset is not shown in the insurance add dialog.
