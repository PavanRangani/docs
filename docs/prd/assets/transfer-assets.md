# Transfer Assets

## Overview

- Real life use case
  - Sunny transferred his home into a Trust.
  - Bob and Deb George will be transferring their homes into a Trust. 
- To handle above cases asset need to removed from one entity and needs to be added to another manually
- To solve that problem we have introduced feature to transfer asset from one legal entity to another legal entity

- Assets can be only transferred to another legal entity of the same family.

## Transfer

- At the time of transfer, it asks for `Transfer Date` date and `Transferred To` legal entity.
  - If the current asset has a `Purchase Date`, the `Transfer Date` date should always be equal to or greater than the `Purchase Date`.  If the asset does not have a `Purchase Date` then the user can add any date to the `Transfer Date`.
  - Only show the Active legal entity of the Assets family (Asset's Owners Family) in the `Transferred To` field. And Source Legal entity does not come in `Transferred To` field dropdown.
- Assets can be linked with many types of Banking. In Banking, the asset field allows to select only assets of the same legal entity. 
  - If an asset is linked in active Banking, it doesnâ€™t allow to transfer. If it's linked with Disposed Banking, transfer is allowed.
- Assets can also be linked to Insurance. Asset field in insurance allows to select assets of any legal entity of the same family.
  - Suppose an asset is linked in Insurance. When that asset is transferred to any other legal entity, it will remain linked with existing insurance as it is after the transfer. 	
  - Once Asset is transferred, Insurance Carrier will also transfer with that Asset.

### Known Case

- If an entity has an asset transferred from another entity, that entity cannot be deleted.
  - Ex. If an asset of `Individuals 1`  is transferred to another entity `Trust 1` for the same family. Now user deletes the `Trust 1` entity but that entity `Trust 1` is not deleted, because the asset of `Individuals 1` is linked with `Trust 1`. So the system will restrict to delete `Trust 1` entity.
