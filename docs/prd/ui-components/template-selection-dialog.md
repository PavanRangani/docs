# Template Selection dialog

## UX Rule
- Allows to select template from the Task or Trigger dialog.
- When user clicks on the template field or Icon, opens the template selection dialog. 
- Shows proper message in the `Family` and `Template name` section until Frequency & Section isn't selected.
    - Frequency section: It shows type of frequency. Like `One-Time`, `Recurring` & `Custom`
    - Section: Its shows type of section.
    - Family: Applicable only when Custom frequency is selected. It shows all families in alphabetical order having custom frequency template.
    - Template Name: It shows template name. If template name is too long, shows it in multiline. (Never shows elipsis)
