## View as other user

### System Rule
- A `View as` function will allow one user to view another's family's activities. There will be no restrictions on which users can view other users' queues.
- Any user (Admin or non-admin) will have a `View as: All` option available using which he/she can see the activity of all users across the application.

- In the `View as` dropdown, the `View as All` action is shown first and login user name is shown second and the other user names are shown in alphabetical order.
- Shows the `You` word in the bracket for the Login user in the dropdown.
- When the user changes the `View as`, the system will reset the filter to its default value.


## Export Excel

### System Rule
- Export functionality isn't available when the list page doesnâ€™t have any records.
- Column will be same as [UI](#ux-rule). Excel has some additional columns:
    - Due Date
        - If the activity is not completed and its due date is overdue, show the due date in red color.
    - Distribution price per Share
    - Quantity
    - Notes
        - Shows the activity note
- Downloaded Excel file name: `capital-call-and-distribution.xlsx`
- Shows values of applied filter criteria as a table in Excel as per the following logic
    - Generated On
        - Shows the date when the Excel file is downloaded.
    - `Family`, `Investor`, `Fund`, `Activity` & `Issue Date`
        - When downloaded without any filter, Shows default value
        - When any multiple values are selected in the filter, then shows the count in the filter otherwise shows the name.
            - Ex. If the user export the Excel file with 2 families, then shows 2 Families in the family filter criteria.

### UX Rule
- Excel icon isn't applicable when the list page doesn't have any task.
- On click, the Excel file will be downloaded on the same page.

### UI Rule
- [Sample file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fh0DHaRlFg3hapHxXDZq23J1rCNVvUW8/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108870014519956519924&rtpof=true&sd=true) //



## Design Decision

**Why pagination is not implemented for this report?**
- Both types of activity have 2 records. One is for Cash Distribution and the second one is for Stock Distribution. So a total of 2 records will be shown for a single activity. That's why pagination is not possible.

**Why doesn't the `Investor` filter show default disabled?**
- Sue wants to show only those families, Investor, and Fund which has activity. Due to implementing this requirement, we have not added a dependency on filter criteria. That's why the Investor filter is not shown disabled.
