## Design Decision

**Why pagination is not implemented for this report?**
- Both type activity has 2 records. One is for Cash Distribution and second one is for Stock Distribution. So total 2 records will be shown for single activity. That's why pagination is not possible.

**Why doesn't the `Investor` filter show default disabled?**
- Sue want to show only those famiily, Investor and Fund which has activity. Due to implement this requirement, we have not add depedency on filter criteria. That's why Investor filter is not shown disabled.
