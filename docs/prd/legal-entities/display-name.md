# Display Name

## Overview
- Some of person of athena have their own nicknames. By which people know him. That's why we have provided the `Display Name` feature in Athena so that the user's `Display Name` appears instead of the user's name everywhere in the application.

## System Rule
- Display names are used in PDFs and some plaes in applications where we show Individual and Joint name. Like, legal entity dropdown, Browse page, Task, Search result, Entoty search dropodwn, Reports etc.

## UX Rule
- Applicable only for Individual and Joint. Its a free form text input field.
- If an individual has a `Display Name` then the system will show the `Display Name` instead of the individual name everywhere throughout the application. 

## UI Rule
- Mockups of Individual
- Mockup of Joint

### Why haven't we included `Display name` in the uniqueness rule of regular Contact and Individuals?

Most of the time, it is not possible that Legal names of two person are same. But Display name of two persons can be same. So we haven't included it in uniqueness rule
