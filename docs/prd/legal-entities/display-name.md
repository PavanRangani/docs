### Why haven't we included `Display name` in the uniqueness rule of regular Contact and Individuals?

Currently, we show legal names in the contact dropdown. In real life there is a case where both "Display Name" and "Contact Name" are the same. Now if we implement uniqueness in the “Display name” field with “Contact” and “Individuals”. So there is one real life case when both legal name and display name both are the same. So if we implement uniqueness then we can not add the same name.
