# Overview

Many clients of Clarius group are employees at higher positions in big tech companies. Tech companies generally provides grant of Restricted stock or options to their employees in addition to salary. This incentivizes employees to stay with the company. If the employee leaves, the company can repurchase the stock.

Generally these grants are in form of **Restricted Stock** or **Stock Options**. Each grant has some time-based vesting schedule which is defined at the time grant is issued.

There is some difference in Restricted Stock &  Stock option. In Restricted stock, you own the shares from the day they are issued. A stock option gives you the right to buy a set number of shares at a fixed price, but you donâ€™t own the shares until you buy them.
