# Overview

Many clients of Clarius group are employees at higher positions in big tech companies. Tech companies generally provides grant of Restricted stock or options to their employees in addition to salary. This incentivizes employees to stay with the company. If the employee leaves, the company can repurchase the stock.

Generally these grants are in form of **Restricted Stock** or **Stock Options**. Each grant has some time-based vesting schedule which is defined at the time grant is issued.

There is some difference in Restricted Stock &  Stock option. In Restricted stock, you own the shares from the day they are issued. A stock option gives you the right to buy a set number of shares at a fixed price, but you donâ€™t own the shares until you buy them. 

In Private equity fund or VC fund, its fund manager is incentivized with **Carried interest**. Carried interest is a share of any profits that fund manager receive as compensation regardless of whether they contribute any initial funds.

There are two types of **Stock options**: NQSO (Non-Qualified Stock Option) & ISO (Incentive Stock Option)

There are two types of **Restricted Stocks**: RSA (Restricted Stock Award) & RSU (Restricted Stock Unit)

One more grant type is **Stock Grant**



For Private and Public company, Stock and options type grants are allowed. Carried interest is not allowed. 

For Limited Partnership, only Carried interest is allowed, Stock or Options are not allowed.

Sometimes, Grant can be altered early because of a merger/acquisition or retirement/termination. There are three possible alterations: 

1. Forfeit - individual walks away from the incentive stock
2. Accelerate - the terms of the incentive stock are accelerated to a current date.  Typical in a merger/sale.
3. Exchange - incentive stock with one company may be exchanged with incentive stock in a new company.  

Athena allows to perform above actions for each vesting schedule. For diffent grants types, different actions are applicable. for e.g. Carried Interest can only be forfeited (It can't be Accelerated or Exchange)
